<!-- NOTE: The script tag and it's code has been moved to the end of the body so 
    that the document.getElementById() function can find the alertButton element. If 
    the script tag were to remain in the head of the document, the 
    document.getElementById() function would not be able to locate the button since 
    it had not yet been rendered.-->

    <!-- Callbacks are used for more than just button clicks. setTimeout is a function 
        that will wait some period of time and then run the function that you specify as 
        a parameter. This allows you to schedule your process to continue at a later 
        point in time (perhaps after an animation has completed), or if you wanted to 
        check on something periodically.-->
