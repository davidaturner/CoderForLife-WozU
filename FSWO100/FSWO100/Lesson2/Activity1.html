He then moved into IT writing device drivers and testing small C++ apps for Formtek Lockheed-Martin. Mr. Turner then spent more than a decade programming Java backend programs and, after 15 years, had realized that knowing a couple software languages was not enough in keeping up a competitive edge in today's job market.
